On the second day of VMworld 2012 Steve Herrod, VMware’s Chief Technology Officer, discussed our vision and advancements in End-User Computing. In essence, organizations are moving away from managing physical devices and towards managing and securing a user’s corporate identity, corporate applications and business data. This has been known as the ‘post PC era‘. However, the connotation of ‘post PC’ doesn’t mean ‘<em>no PC</em>’, but instead it means ’<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>not just a PC</em>’.

In fact, people use multiple devices including desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile phones throughout their day. They seek unified, synchronize access on all their devices. This means that business apps and data are available in the most optimal and seamless way possible, safely and securely delivered to all your devices, no matter where you happen to be working from or from what device.

Herrod discussed the progress that we’ve made on our path to this <em>multi-device workspace</em> by giving a technical preview of the industry’s first integrated platform for the mobile, multi-device workspace – the <strong>VMware Horizon Suite</strong>. He shared many of its exciting capabilities that provide self-service access to all apps and data across devices including mobile-centric containers for management and security.

Herrod demonstrated how VMware is broadening of our portfolio, delivering both Windows as a Service for the multi-device world and Windows image management solutions for the Mobile workforce with the combination of VMware View and Wanova Mirage to enable customers to transform the legacy Windows desktop for the cloud era. Herrod also provided technical previews of a “User Interface Virtualization” that will transform numerous aspects of Windows desktop and application interfaces into a rich tablet friendly user experience in addition to a managed mobile workspace for both iOS and Android devices.

<em>Let’s dive into the announcement and technical previews...</em>
<h3><Horizon Suite: The Platform for the Mobile Workforce</h3>
The VMware Horizon Suite will bring together technologies from Project Octopus, Project AppBlast, ThinApp, VMware Horizon Application Manager and VMware Horizon Mobile into an integrated management platform for the mobile workforce. The VMware Horizon Suite will provide a flexible platform that uniquely combines the principles of identity, context and policy to separate personal and business workspaces, enable consistent access to applications and data across any personal device.

Through a central web management console, the <strong>Horizon Application Manager</strong> will allow organizations to customize a service catalog for all company data and applications. The technolgy will understand a user’s attributes and environment (device, location and connectivity level) and enforce policies across applications, data and desktops. This will allow IT to deliver View Desktops, Windows, Android, iOS, Web ThinApp’d, SaaS and even published XenApp applications in a single workspace and give end-users self-service access to applications and data from anywhere.

Vittorio Viarengo, Vice President of End User Computing shared a sneak peak of the VMware Horizon Application Manager interface. Check it out below.

Horizon Suite alpha will also allow end-users to securely access and share their data and files from any device through <strong>Horizon Data</strong>, formerly known as Project Octopus.

The VMware Horizon Suite will also feature the HTML remoting technologies that we demoed last year as part of Project AppBlast. In this first release the solution will use the HTML remoting protocol to give user access to their View desktops from any HTML5 compatible browser.

Providing dual persona (work and personal) functionality is the future of mobile computing, where users and IT both get what they need through a managed mobile workspace that securely delivering apps, files and data. <strong>Horizon Mobile</strong> which is extending its reach beyond Android to iOS devices, providing policy-based management and security for collections of corporate resources on both iOS and Android devices. Horizon Mobile features are designed to enable policy specification, implementation, enforcement &amp; remediation for the mobile workspace.

Policies *only* apply when a user accesses corporate content. You will also see how we protect data. Data is protected at rest with encryption, data is protected in transit, and data access is controlled so only work apps can access enterprise data. In fact, unmodified, native iOS apps can be added to the workspace and they will automatically inherit the security policies defined – <em>all without compromising usability and maintaining native look and feel.</em>

<h3><Project App Shift</h3>
There was also a technical preview of a User Interface Virtualization (a.k.a. Project AppShift) technology. A primary use case for VDI and application remoting is delivering Windows desktops and applications to non-Windows tablet devices in a multi-device workspace. No matter how good the remote graphics protocol is, trying to use a point and click interface on a gesture oriented tablet can be a frustrating user experience. VMware is advancing a unique technology that we refer to as “User Interface Virtualization.” With this technology approach, we’re able to transform numerous aspects of Windows desktop and application interfaces into a rich tablet friendly user experience. Like other virtualization technologies, our approach is completely transparent to existing Windows applications.
