Today, VMware is pleased to announce the VMware vCenter Support Assistant and the beta program for our VMware TAM Program customers.

<strong>OVERVIEW</strong>

The VMware vCenter Support Assistant streamlines access and saves you time and effort by integrating the creation of VMware Technical Support Requests and the attachment of support diagnostic information within a single application.

You can also use the VMware vCenter Support Assistant to file support requests for any product that you already have support entitlement for – whether that entitlement is via subscription, or paid‐for incident packs

The VMware vCenter Support Assistant is deployed as a virtual appliance and Integrates with VMware vCenter Server as a plug‐in that can be accessed using either the VMware vSphere Client or the VMware vSphere Web Client. The Support Assistant allows the user to collect and upload diagnostic information from both the VMware vCenter Server and vSphere hosts, in addition to creating and viewing existing Technical Support Requests.

<strong>THE BETA PROGRAM</strong>

<em>What is the Beta Program?</em>

The beta program is a highly‐valued way for VMware to get direct feedback from customers on our products and systems. In return, customers are able to experience our products before they are released publicly, and have the opportunity to shape the GA product and future roadmap.

<em>How do I participate?</em>

The beta program is open to VMware Technical Account Manager customers. To participate, simply contact your VMware Technical Account Manager.

If you are not a VMware TAM Program customer you can <a title="Request Access to VMware vCenter Support Assistant Beta Program for Non- VMware TAM Program Customers" href="http://www.surveymethods.com/EndUser.aspx?98BCD0C99BDBCCC99F " target="_blank">sign-up and request access</a> to the program.

Shortly after you notify us of your interest in participating, you will receive an invite to a private “<em>Support Assistant Beta Community</em>”. Please note that invitations can take up to 24 hours to be processed.

Both the product download and installation instructions will be available once you log in to this private community.

<em>What should I do with the Beta Product?</em>

Simply use Support Assistant to file your technical support requests, instead of calling in or using my.vmware.com. Explore the capabilities for generating and attaching diagnostic information and attaching other files, such as screenshots.
