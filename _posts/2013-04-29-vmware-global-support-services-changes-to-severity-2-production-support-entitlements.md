In an effort to improve the service level of Severity 1 Support Requests (SRs), provide more meaningful first response and increase the frequency of contact while working SRs, VMware Global Support Services (GSS) has made some service changes to better manage SRs proactively and ultimately improve your support experience.

Effective <strong>22 April 2013</strong>, Severity 2 <a href="http://www.vmware.com/support/services/production.html" target="_blank">Production Support Entitlement</a> SRs have moved to a call-back model. When contacting support at 877-4VMWARE on new and existing Severity 2 SRs, you will be provided with a call-back within the 4-hour Service Level Agreement. This already happens today for all Production Support Severity 3 and Severity 4 SRs.

My recommendations for best practices remain the same:

<strong>Understanding Severity Levels</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The severity level is a measure of the relative impact of the technical issue on your systems or business.</li>
	<li>Accurately defining the severity ensures a timely response and helps VMware GSS to understand the nature of your issue.</li>
	<li>Refer to <a href="https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/severity.html" target="_blank">VMware Severity and Response Times</a> for severity definitions.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Opening a Severity 1 (Production Down) SR</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Contact VMware GSS at 877-4VMWARE.</li>
	<li>Be prepared to work the case 24x7.</li>
	<li>Immediately collect diagnostics/logs and attached these to the case.</li>
	<li>Consider using the <a href="http://www.vmware.com/go/vcsa" target="_blank">VMware vCenter Support Assistant</a> to automate and expedite the process.</li>
	<li>Request that your TAM is added as a secondary email on the SR.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Opening a Severity 2 SR</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Open your case through My VMware (<a href="https://my.vmware.com/" target="_blank">https://my.vmware.com</a>) or the <a href="http://www.vmware.com/go/vcsa" target="_blank">VMware vCenter Support Assistant</a> (highly recommended)</li>
	<li>Immediately collect diagnostics/logs and attached these to the case.</li>
	<li>Add your TAM as a secondary email on the SR.</li>
	<li>Expect a call-back within the SLA - 4hrs or less.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Opening a Severity 3 or 4 SR</strong>
<ul>
	<li>Open your case through My VMware (<a href="https://my.vmware.com/" target="_blank">https://my.vmware.com</a>) or the <a href="http://www.vmware.com/go/vcsa" target="_blank">VMware vCenter Support Assistant</a> (highly recommended)</li>
	<li>Immediately collect diagnostics/logs and attached these to the case.</li>
	<li>Expect a call-back within the SLA - 8hrs or less for S3 and 12hrs or less for S4.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Escalating and SR</strong>
There may be times when you need to escalate a support request with VMware. The escalation process is especially appropriate in the following situations.
<ul>
	<li>Your production system goes down during an upgrade or other implementation.</li>
	<li>You need to communicate a critical business impact to VMware Support Management.</li>
	<li>You are dissatisfied with the responsiveness to or resolution of a support request.</li>
</ul>
Should an escalation situation arise:
<ul>
	<li>Contact your TAM immediately and he/she will personally invoke the escalation process.</li>
	<li>Speak with a Technical Support Duty Manager by calling 877-4VMWARE and request a severity increase for the SR.</li>
</ul>
<h3>So, You Might Be Thinking...</h3>

<p>1. Why I do not have an option of live support anymore

<ul>
	<li>Severity 1 SRs still have an option of getting live queue support.</li>
	<li>This will eliminate the wait times if you are seeking support assistance on non-production down but urgent issues.</li>
	<li>This will enable us to provide meaningful response towards the technical issues raised and quicker resolution times.</li>
</ul>

<p>2. When I can expect contact from VMware GSS going forward for my SRs?

</div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>When calling on Severity 2, 3 and 4 SRs you will be provided with a call-back within SLA.</li>
	<li>Refer to <a href="https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/severity.html" target="_blank">VMware Severity and Response Times</a> for VMware business hours and severity definitions.</li>
	<li>Production Severity 2 (S2) – 4 Business Hours</li>
	<li>Production Severity 3 (S3) – 8 Business Hours</li>
	<li>Production Severity 4 (S4) – 12 Business Hours</li>
</ul>

<p>3. How do I contact VMware GSS / my TSE, if I need immediate help?

<ul>
	<li>You can reach the TSE assigned to your SR by calling 877-4VMWARE and using our voice-recognition system. After entering your SR number your call will be routed to the assigned TSE.</li>
	<li>Refer to support phone numbers at <a href="http://www.vmware.com/in/support/contacts/us_support.html" target="_blank">http://www.vmware.com/in/support/contacts/us_support.html</a>.</li>
	<li>You can reach the assigned TSE by reviewing the Manager contact information available in TSEs email signature.</li>
	<li>You can speak to a Customer Service Representative by calling 877-4VMWARE.</li>
</ul>

<p>4. Does this change affect all VMware products and entitlements?

<ul>
	<li>This change is applicable for only certain products which had live phone queue support options. (eg VMware vSphere, VMware vCenter Product Family, VMware Horizon Product Family, VMware vFabric...)</li>
	<li>There is no change for products which were already classified as callback.</li>
	<li>This change is applicable for only Production Support Entitlement.</li>
</ul>

<p>5. If I have BCS or MCS support, do I still have an option of live phone queue support?

<ul>
	<li>Yes, these entitlement offerings will not change.</li>

</ul>

<p>7. How do I get access to live queue?

<ul>
	<li>If you are having a production down situations you will have access to live phone queue support provided that SR is severity 1.</li>
	<li>Speak with a Customer Service Representatives or Duty Manager by calling 877-4VMWARE and request the severity be raised to Severity 1 for the SR if it is a production down situations. This will enable live queue access.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
