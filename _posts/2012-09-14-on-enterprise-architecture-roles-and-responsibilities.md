The following groups are used throughout this the Enterprise Architecture concepts I present on this site..More full descriptions will be provided in an example Enterprise Architecture Charter.

<h2>Information Technology Governance Committee</h2>

The Information Technology Governance Committee (“ITGC”) is the top-level decision-making authority for the Enterprise Architecture Program. The IT Governance Committee has primary decision authority over the Enterprise Architecture. For practical purposes, the authority for day-to-day architecture decision making is delegated by the IT Governance Committee to the Enterprise Architecture Governance Committee. The IT Governance Committee also has responsibility for setting direction and priorities for the organization technology strategy, and this role extends to Enterprise Architecture.

<h2>Enterprise Architecture Governance Committee</h2>

The Enterprise Architecture Governance Committee (“EAGC”) is a cross-functional committee, typically chaired by the Vice Presidents of Technology and Development and including the Enterprise Architects. Associate non-voting members may be members of the committee and are elected via consensus among the Enterprise Architects and the committee chairs. The Enterprise Architecture Governance Committee has delegated authority to make day-to-day Enterprise Architecture decisions.

<h2>Enterprise Architecture Office</h2>

The Enterprise Architecture Office (“EAO”) is a cross-functional technology group composed of the Enterprise Architect(s). The Enterprise Architecture Office is responsible for developing the architecture processes and the architecture assurance process, driving the development of the Enterprise Architecture Program, and creating and maintaining deliverables.

<h2>Information Technology Management Committee Enterprise Architecture Subcommittee</h2>

The IT Management Committee Enterprise Architecture Subcommittee (“ITMC-EA”) consists of all management personal within the information technology organization.

<h2>Enterprise Architecture Domain Experts</h2>

The Enterprise Architecture Domain Experts (“EADX”) are trusted advisors to the Enterprise Architecture Program. The Enterprise Architecture Domain Experts may include subject matter experts, supervisors, managers, directors or other that work within the Enterprise Architecture function for brief and/or periodic assignments.
