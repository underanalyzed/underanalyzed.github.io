On the second day of VMworld 2012 Steve Herrod, VMware’s Chief Technology Officer, discussed our vision and advancements in End-User Computing. In essence, organizations are moving away from managing physical devices and towards managing and securing a user’s corporate identity, corporate applications and business data. This has been known as the ‘post PC era‘. However, the connotation of ‘post PC’ doesn’t mean ‘<em>no PC</em>’, but instead it means ’<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">not just a PC</em>’.

In fact, people use multiple devices including desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile phones throughout their day. They seek unified, synchronize access on all their devices. This means that business apps and data are available in the most optimal and seamless way possible, safely and securely delivered to all your devices, no matter where you happen to be working from or from what device.

Herrod discussed the progress that we’ve made on our path to this <em>multi-device workspace</em> by giving a technical preview of the industry’s first integrated platform for the mobile, multi-device workspace – the <strong>VMware Horizon Suite</strong>. He shared many of its exciting capabilities that provide self-service access to all apps and data across devices including mobile-centric containers for management and security.

Herrod demonstrated how VMware is broadening of our portfolio, delivering both Windows as a Service for the multi-device world and Windows image management solutions for the Mobile workforce with the combination of VMware View and Wanova Mirage to enable customers to transform the legacy Windows desktop for the cloud era. Herrod also provided technical previews of a “User Interface Virtualization” that will transform numerous aspects of Windows desktop and application interfaces into a rich tablet friendly user experience in addition to a managed mobile workspace for both iOS and Android devices.

<em>Let’s dive into the second day announcement and technical previews…</em>

<h3>Horizon Suite: The Platform for the Mobile Workforce</h3>
The VMware Horizon Suite will bring together technologies from Project Octopus, Project AppBlast, ThinApp, VMware Horizon Application Manager and VMware Horizon Mobile into an integrated management platform for the mobile workforce. The VMware Horizon Suite will provide a flexible platform that uniquely combines the principles of identity, context and policy to separate personal and business workspaces, enable consistent access to applications and data across any personal device.

Through a central web management console, the <strong>Horizon Application Manager</strong> will allow organizations to customize a service catalog for all company data and applications. The technolgy will understand a user’s attributes and environment (device, location and connectivity level) and enforce policies across applications, data and desktops. This will allow IT to deliver View Desktops, Windows, Android, iOS, Web ThinApp’d, SaaS and even published XenApp applications in a single workspace and give end-users self-service access to applications and data from anywhere.

Horizon Suite alpha will also allow end-users to securely access and share their data and files from any device through <strong>Horizon Data</strong>, formerly known as Project Octopus.

The VMware Horizon Suite will also feature the HTML remoting technologies that we demoed last year as part of Project AppBlast. In this first release the solution will use the HTML remoting protocol to give user access to their View desktops from any HTML5 compatible browser.

Providing dual persona (work and personal) functionality is the future of mobile computing, where users and IT both get what they need through a managed mobile workspace that securely delivering apps, files and data. <strong>Horizon Mobile</strong> which is extending its reach beyond Android to iOS devices, providing policy-based management and security for collections of corporate resources on both iOS and Android devices. Horizon Mobile features are designed to enable policy specification, implementation, enforcement &amp; remediation for the mobile workspace.

Policies *only* apply when a user accesses corporate content. You will also see how we protect data. Data is protected at rest with encryption, data is protected in transit, and data access is controlled so only work apps can access enterprise data. In fact, unmodified, native iOS apps can be added to the workspace and they will automatically inherit the security policies defined – <em>all without compromising usability and maintaining native look and feel.</em>
<h3>Technical Preview: Project App Shift</h3>
There was also a technical preview of a User Interface Virtualization (a.k.a. Project AppShift) technology. A primary use case for VDI and application remoting is delivering Windows desktops and applications to non-Windows tablet devices in a multi-device workspace. No matter how good the remote graphics protocol is, trying to use a point and click interface on a gesture oriented tablet can be a frustrating user experience. VMware is advancing a unique technology that we refer to as “User Interface Virtualization.” With this technology approach, we’re able to transform numerous aspects of Windows desktop and application interfaces into a rich tablet friendly user experience. Like other virtualization technologies, our approach is completely transparent to existing Windows applications.

<strong><a title="STO1430 Presentation" href="http://download3.vmware.com/vmworld/2012/top10/sto1430.pdf" target="_blank">STO1430: Tracking Down Storage Performance Issues: A Customer’s Perspective</a></strong>
Speakers: Keith Aasen, NetApp, Scott Elliott, Christie Digital

<iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/nBPRMPm1YG0?rel=0" frameborder="0" width="420" height="315"></iframe>

With a VMware vSphere® implementation in several sites across four countries and three continents, Christie was well underway with its virtualization journey. The company had selected NetApp as its storage solution and had successfully grown the infrastructure to over 500 virtual machines, with many more planned for upcoming projects. However, as the numbers of virtual machines grew in the main office in Canada, strange errors started to appear. At first they were rare and very intermittent, but then began to grown at an alarming rate of frequency and intensity. Disk latencies skyrocketed to thousands of milliseconds, multiple applications unexpectedly failed over to recovery sites or crashed altogether, in-process transactions were lost, and the stability of both the storage and vSphere was called into question. Several projects were temporarily suspended until the storage issues could be resolved, including the VMware vCenter™ Site Recovery Manager™ implementation and storage-array virtual machine backup projects. Tracking down the problem, however, proved to be difficult. Initial troubleshooting efforts were unsuccessful in pinpointing the issue, and even falsely flagged some of the symptoms as being the root problem. Leveraging expertise from NetApp, and using different packages from third-party software venders, we gradually identified and correct issues. Every issue we identified and rectified gave us further insight into addressing the remaining issues. In the end, we discovered that it was no one of the several "suboptimal" configurations that were responsible for the performance issues but rather their collective influence, which placed significant stress on the storage subsystem.

<strong><a title="EUC1305 Presentation" href="http://download3.vmware.com/vmworld/2012/top10/euc1305.pdf" target="_blank">EUC1305: What's New and What's Next for VMware View</a></strong>

<strong><em><a href="http://www.pearsonitcertification.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=9780321799937">Storage Design and Implementation in vSphere 5.0</a></em></strong><strong> </strong>by Mostafa Khalil<strong>
</strong>The more important VMware virtualized infrastructure becomes, the more important virtualization storage becomes. Virtualization storage planning and management is complex, and it's been almost impossible to find authoritative guidance - until now. In Storage Implementation in vSphere 5.0, one of VMware's leading experts completely demystifies the "black box" of vSphere storage, and provides illustrated, step-by-step procedures for performing virtually every task associated with it. Mostafa Khalil brings together detailed techniques and guidelines, insights for better architectural design, planning and management best practices, common configuration details, and deep dives into both vSphere and external storage-related technologies. He gives technical professionals the deep understanding they need to make better choices, solve problems, and keep problems from occurring in the first place. This book answers crucial, ground-level questions such as: How do you configure storage array from "Vendor X" to support vSphere "Feature Y"? How do you know you've configured it correctly? What happens if you misconfigure it? How can you tell from logs and other tools that you have a problem - and how do you fix it? Most of the author's troubleshooting techniques are based on his own personal experience as a senior VMware support engineer helping customers troubleshoot their own vSphere production environments - experience that nobody else has.

<strong><em><a href="http://www.pearsonitcertification.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=9780321832214">VMware vSphere 5 Building a Virtual Datacenter</a></em></strong><strong> </strong>by Eric Maille and René-Francois Mennecier<strong>
</strong>Every year, datacenter managers must deliver more services faster, with greater flexibility. They must efficiently handle soaring amounts of data, and unprecedented levels of complexity. And they must do all this with lower budgets and fewer resources. Datacenter virtualization with VMware’s vSphere® 5 is the best way to achieve these goals and to accelerate your transition to cloud services. VMware vSphere® 5: Building a Virtual Datacenter brings together all the practical knowledge you need to evaluate, plan, implement, and manage vSphere 5 in your datacenter environment.<strong></strong>

Top datacenter virtualization consultants Eric Maillé and René-François Mennecier begin by introducing vSphere 5 from the viewpoint of the datacenter manager and professional. They present essential definitions, advantages, and functions; review vSphere 5’s architecture; and introduce core components  such as vCenter Server and ESXi 5.0.

Next, Maillé and Mennecier turn to implementation, presenting detailed examples, schemas, and best practices drawn from their extensive experience. They share practical insights into budgeting, scheduling, and planning; choosing the right architecture; and integrating vSphere with existing datacenter elements, including servers, storage, clusters, network infrastructure, and business continuity plans. They conclude  with a start-to-finish case study: a datacenter virtualization project designed to support specific  business objectives.
