<p><strong>No. 3: </strong>Solution Exchange

<p>The Solutions Exchange is undoubtedly the most action-packed part of VMworld.

<p>The industry’s most forward-thinking IT solution providers convene in the expo space every year to showcase their innovative products and meet their customers and partners. Be sure to schedule your time and visit these sponsors. This is an amazing opportunity to explore and learn about new cloud-era innovations. Don’t just get your badge scanned – get a live demo, ask the difficult questions and get a datasheet or card so you can follow-up after the conference.

<p>Booths range from the small pods to entire palazzos on the show floor. This year, over 300 exhibitors will be there for you to visit. The VMware booth will include technology demos, and expert bar, and theater presentations.

<p>And – of course – get the swag and get registered for sponsor giveaways.

<p><strong>No. 4: </strong>Hands-On Labs

<p>Each year the VMworld Hands-On Labs (HOLs) are a huge attraction at VMworld. This year will be no different as VMware continues to innovate and provide a user experience greater than any other in the industry. The HOLs are designed around typical customer use case and business scenarios. This allows conference attendees to have a hands-on experience exercising workflows that relate to real-world scenarios.

<p>Take on the HOLs to get more in-depth knowledge of these innovative technologies that you want to learn more about.  If you need help with a lab, flag down a lab captain to speak with a product expert.

<p>Plus, you can take advantage of the the BYOD Lab Hot Spots across the <a href="http://download3.vmware.com/community/pdfs/vmworld-2013-campus-map.pdf" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','http://download3.vmware.com/community/pdfs/vmworld-2013-campus-map.pdf']);"  target="_blank">VMworld Campus</a>!

<p><strong>No. 5: </strong>Breakout Sessions

<p>Choose from more than 300 Breakout Sessions covering topics such as the hybrid cloud, enabling IT as a service and delivering end-user freedom while maintaining IT control.  Visit the <a href="https://vmworld2013.activeevents.com/connect/search.ww" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://vmworld2013.activeevents.com/connect/search.ww', 'VMworld 2013 Content Catalog']);"  target="_blank">VMworld 2013 Content Catalog</a> today and explore the session topics, abstracts and presenters across a range of session tracks – IT transformation, applications, end-user computing, infrastructure, and operations as well as sponsor sessions.

<p>The <a href="https://www.vmworld.com/schedulebuilder-login.jspa" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.vmworld.com/schedulebuilder-login.jspa', 'Schedule Builder']);"  target="_blank">Schedule Builder</a> allows you to register for the sessions you want to attend.  In order to get into a session <a href="https://www.vmworld.com/schedulebuilder-login.jspa" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.vmworld.com/schedulebuilder-login.jspa', 'you must register']);"  target="_blank">you must register</a>.  You will not be able to book multiple sessions as the same time. Registering doesn’t mean that you must attend but keep in mind that if you register and don’t attend someone else is missing the session.

<p>There will be many <em>must see </em>sessions. If you review the content catalog and look at the presenters you will notice that presenters are experts – engineers, solution and consulting architects as well as product managers. Many of the names may be familiar to you and the community. Be sure to sign up, as these will fill up very quickly.

<p>The good news is, that if it is a popular session it may be repeated on another day/time. Popular sessions will repeat at least once during the conference. Remember to check the schedule daily – the VMworld event staff will put out daily updates that show any changes, additions, and deletions to the schedule.

<p>Be careful about scheduling sessions back-to-back. Sessions are spread out across the VMworld Campus and there is a chance that the next breakout session is a not near the last. If you’re registered for a session you should have a seat available but if you are late you might not be able to get in.

<p><strong>Imagine Dragons</strong>

<p><a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/tam/files/2013/08/vmw2013-photo-id-lg.jpg" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blogs.vmware.com/tam/files/2013/08/vmw2013-photo-id-lg.jpg', '']);" ><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1090" title="Imagine Dragons" alt="" src="http://blogs.vmware.com/tam/files/2013/08/vmw2013-photo-id-lg-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" /></a>Imagine Dragons (frontman Dan Reynolds, guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist Ben McKee, and drummer Daniel Platzman) independently released three EPs, toured extensively, and racked up numerous best-of-Vegas awards. Then, earlier this year, the band made their major label debut with the release of their Continued Silence EP available on Grammy award winning producer Alex Da Kid’s (Eminem, Rihanna) label, KIDinaKORNER. From the epic slow-burn throb of “Radioactive” to the upbeat percussive intimacy of “On Top of the World” to the delicate blend of acoustic guitar and synthetic pop on “Round and Round,” the collection showcases Imagine Dragons’ signature diversity of sound and sentiment. “It’s Time,” the EP’s anthemic, emotionally bare, foot-stomping lead single has become Imagine Dragon’s calling card. And it’s the song that sets the tone for what’s to come as the band prepares to enter the studio this summer to record their full-length debut with Alex Da Kid.

<p><strong>Train</strong>
