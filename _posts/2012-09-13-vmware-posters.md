Just the other day I was discussing with Alan Renouf the excellent posters that VMware Technical Marketing puts together for our customers. Alan had just posted the VMware PowerCLI 5.1 poster and I suggested that we should make these easily available from one easy location. Today, Alan did just that and <a title="VMware Posters Blog Post by Alan Renouf" href="http://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2012/09/vmware-posters.html" target="_blank">posted</a> these online and I followed up by creating <a title="VMware Posters" href="http://vmware.com/go/posters/" target="_blank">vmware.com/go/posters/</a> for an easy to remember URL.

Check it out. Right now these include:

<ul>
	<li>VMware vCloud Suite Poster</li>
    <li>VMware ESXi 5.1 Reference Poster</li>
	<li>VMware Management with PowerCLI 5.8 R1 Poster</li>
	<li>VMware vCloud Networking Poster</li>
	<li>VMware Hands-On Labs 2013 Poster</li>
    <li>VMware vCloud SDKs Poster</li>
</ul>
