1. Be Aware And Respectful
“The number one important thing to remember is to be respectful of the other runners. If you are a walker, it is still important to pay attention to those who are racing and don’t walk four or five abreast. Give runners enough space to run their race; it is a race first and foremost.”

2. Turn Down The Tunes
“If you must wear headphones, have the volume at a respectful level. Some races don’t have an entirely closed course, but even if they do, don’t make any assumptions that it’s safe out there. If the race does its job it should be, but you never know and have to be able to be aware if something does come up.

3. Don’t Bandit
“My perspective on banditing has certainly changed since I was running in college. Running a race you haven’t paid for is just bad. You’re using the resources of the race and it costs so much to put on a race; it is disrespectful. People think race directors are pocketing all this money and it is just not true. It’s especially bad when there is money going to charities and schools. That is just bad.”

4. Don’t Wallow At Water Stops
“Get in and out of water stops as quickly as possible. You want to let the people behind you get the opportunity to grab water, too.”

5. Read The Instructions
“Be aware of race directions and parking instructions. Don’t wait ‘till the last minute to read the race instructions. Don’t just look at them six months ahead of time when you sign up. Things change all the time. Even if you are completely familiar with the city you are racing in, make sure to read the instructions and find out how you’re going to get to the race.”

6. Know Your Place
“Line up in the correct wave according to your expected pace. If you are a sub-six minute miler, line up in the front row. Place yourself accordingly and ask people around you what they are going to run. You don’t want to get trampled on by faster runners. With time chips you can line up where your pace fits and you’ll have an overall better race.”

7. Say Thank You
“Oh my goodness, yes, thank the volunteers. You don’t need to thank them during the race, but if you can, great. You can thank them simply by putting forth a great effort out there and do your thing. You don’t have to say a word until after the race. If it’s a fun run and you have the energy go for it and say thank you. It can make the volunteer in the middle of nowhere day because they often don’t realise how important they are.”

8. Display Your Number
“Can I have your number? — Put your race number or bib on the front of your body. Don’t fold it up, make it as small as possible, and pin it to your shorts. If your chip isn’t working sometimes your bib number is the only way to get a race time through photos. Some people debate if they really need a number any more, but people still want them as a memento and it can help when a chip fails.”

Avoid sharing your bodily fluids with others. If you must send that snot rocket flying, make sure a runner or spectator is not in its path.

Do not come to a dead stop. There is no shame in stopping or slowing down or walking. For the safety of all involved, move to the side and be aware of who is coming up behind you. The runner behind you doesn’t want to crash into you any more than you want to be trampled.
Do not run more than two people side-by-side. It’s fantastic to have running friends to share the race day experience with. Running is all about community and having a great time. It’s also important to respect the other runners on the course, and running as a pack creates a wall that is hard for someone behind you to pass through.

At the start of the race, line up with others of similar pace. Unless you believe you are fast enough to place, you should not be starting in the front line. Walkers should start at the back. Many races have signs that show where you should start, depending on your pace. If you’re not sure how fast you are, this might be the day to learn… by starting closer to the back.
Pass on the left. Just like with biking, and traveling by car, in the U.S., we pass on the left. If you are running with a group, make sure you’re aware of people who might be trying to pass on your left.

When coming up behind a group, it is acceptable to let them know you are coming through. A simple, “On your left.” Or “Coming through behind you,” will suffice. If someone passes you, be polite. We love our running community and our race day manners should reflect that.
Use your manners. If you knock into someone, or worse… knock them down… apologize. Thank the volunteers at the aid stations for giving up their time. Try to hit the trash cans when tossing cups and gel packets. Nod or wave to the police officers or volunteers managing traffic control. Running is a privilege and we should be respectful and grateful.

Lend encouragement. We’ve all been there, that tough first race, or the race that doesn’t go as planned. A “Good job!” or a high five, or a “Hang in there! You’ve got this!” can often be the spark that helps someone reset their attitude and find the strength to get to the finish line.
Compete against yourself. No matter where you start in the line-up—with the people who run a 7:30 mile or with the people finishing at a 15 minute pace—someone in that group has their heart set on a personal best time that day. We all start at different places, and you should be proud of the work you’ve put in, and where you are today.

Remember personal space. If you are running with a stroller or a dog or are using headphones… keep the personal space of others in mind. No one wants their heels clipped by a stroller or a dog nipping at their calves. And since the runners around you aren’t part of the rock concert in your head, they aren’t going to appreciate it when you come sailing into them and gracefully save your fall by waltzing with them while they are trying to PR.

Do not cut off other runners. Once again, personal space! Watch those tight corners. When passing, know you are capable of surging ahead and maintaining the speed to get out of the pack. No one wants to fall or twist an ankle mid-race.

Remember those at the back of the pack. When it comes to post-race fuel, only take what you need. Others will finish behind you, and everyone deserves to enjoy the post-race experience of food, cheering crowds… and a finish line.

Be aware of flying objects. When disposing of “throw away” clothing, water bottles, cups, gel packets, be considerate of those around you. No one wants to be pelted with your trash or have their path blocked as you wind up for the toss.

Be gracious. We all make race day mistakes. Be courteous and assume that no one is trying to ruin your race day experience. We are all part of the larger running community and should support each other.

Make it a great day for everyone. Fast or slow, rookie or veteran, everyone has a story, and something they have set out to achieve on race day. It might be getting to their first finish line, a celebration of beating a disease, setting a new PR, a fun run to catch up with old friends. Race day is full of people with exciting life stories. Help others be proud of their achievements, help others succeed… and make sure your own behavior doesn’t hinder the progress of others.
