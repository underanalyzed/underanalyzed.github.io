<p>By now, you may have heard that today VMware Education has implemented a <a href="http://blogs.vmware.com/education/2014/03/new-recertification-policy-offers-growth-opportunities.html" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://blogs.vmware.com/education/2014/03/new-recertification-policy-offers-growth-opportunities.html', 'Recertification Policy']);" title="ew Recertification Policy Offers Growth Opportunities"  target="_blank">Recertification Policy</a> (today&#8217;s announcement) and the reactions across the Community have been mixed.

<p>Currently, individuals that have met the requirements and achieved the VMware Certified Professional (&#8220;VCP&#8221;) designation are not required to recertify their skills. VMware believes that this is uncommon in the IT industry as those in our profession are expected to periodically update and/or validate technical a apptitude.

<p>To ensure that these designation individuals maintain their proficiency, VMware is instituting a recertification policy change for the VCP-level certification tracks.

<p>To summarize the policy:

<ul>
    <li>VCP-level certification taken before 10 March 2013 will expire on 10 March 2015.</li>
        <li>VCP-level certifications expire 2 years from the date the certification was achieved.</li>
    <li>No course(s) are required to renew VCP certification(s).</li>
    <li>Any VCP-level or higher exam will renew the VCP certification.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think this policy is step in the right direction and it&#8217;s not too different from others. However, as with most things, there are some general areas for improvement and people can get emotional. After all, in the Community people identify with the VCP. It&#8217;s a badge of honor and an identity. And folks don&#8217;t like it when you mess with their identities.

<p>Below are my thoughts.

<h4>Expire vs Retire</h4>

<p>Response from the community may have more welcoming if the concept of <strong>retiring</strong> certifications had been instead introduced instead of <strong>expiring</strong> certifications. The two have far different connotations and emotional responses.

<p>In my opinion, VMware certifications should go into retirement. The retirement should be mapped to when the last product release in a major release exits General Support per the <a href="https://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/support/Product-Lifecycle-Matrix.pdf" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','download','https://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/support/Product-Lifecycle-Matrix.pdf']);" title="VMware Product Lifecycle Matrix"  target="_blank">VMware Product Lifecycle Matrix.</a>

<p>For example:

<ul>
    <li><strong>VCP4-Datacenter Virtualization</strong> should be retired on <strong>21 May 2014</strong> with the <strong>exit of vSphere 4.x General Support</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>VCP5-Cloud</strong> should be retired on <strong>19 September 2017</strong> with the <strong>exit of vCloud Director 5.5 General Support</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>VCP5-DT</strong> should be retired on <strong>15 September 2016</strong> with the <strong>exit of Horizon View 5.x General Support</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Granted, this approach may be a bit more complicated to implement; however, it serves some very specific needs.

<ul>
    <li>Changes the emotional response from &#8220;taking something away&#8221; to a career enablement and empowerment response.</li>
    <li>Ensures individuals and businesses are prepared in advance to upgrade skills and platforms before products exit General Support.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<h4>Continuing Education</h4>

<p>I am a believer in continuing education, and firmly believe that IT Professionals need ~10+ hours each week to maintain their  skills to stay relevant in the face of relentless change and innovation in technology. Thatâ€™s a big commitment, and one that can be helped with continuing education.

<p>A continuing education unit (CEU) or continuing education credit (CEC) is a measure used in  continuing education programs in order for the professional to maintain the license. Examples of people who need CEUs include: teachers, architects, engineers, educators, and health professionals. Generally, a CEU is defined as ten hours of participation in a recognized continuing education program, with qualified instruction and sponsorship. CEU records are widely used to provide evidence of completion of continuing education requirements mandated by certification bodies, professional societies, or governmental licensing boards.

<p>As an alternative to requiring professionals to take an exam by a specific date to recertify, enable those to achieve success by completing CEU/Cs. These CEU/Cs could be credits from VMware Education Courses, VMware Partner University Courses, VMware <a href="http://vmware.com/go/topfeeecourses" onclick="_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'outbound-article', 'http://vmware.com/go/topfeeecourses', 'free self-paced courses']);"  target="_blank">free self-paced courses</a>, presenting at VMUGs, VMworld, Partner Exchange and other events. These CEU/Cs would be counted and applied as credit towards keeping certifications relevant.

<h4>Unanswered Questions and Final Thoughts</h4>

<p>One thing that stuck out in the policy was that <em>&#8220;&#8230;To recertify, you must pass any VCP or higher-level exam within two years of earning your most recent VCP certification&#8230;&#8221; </em>Unfortunately this does not appear to be the case.

<p>If you take a look at my profile below I passed the following VCP-level exams.

<ul>
    <li>VCP5-DCV in September 2011 (Beta Exam)</li>
    <li>VCP5-Cloud in October 2013</li>
    <li>VCP5-DT in November 2013</li>
</ul>

<p>By virtue of the policy, I have passed<em> &#8220;any VCP&#8230;exam&#8221;</em> and my VCP5-Cloud and VCP5-DCV should have the same expiration as my VCP5-DT. This is not the case as seen below.

<p>As I stated initially, I think this change is a good thing &#8211;  but there are opportunities for improvement.

<p>In the end, we must take ownership of what will keep us relevant and allow us to stand out. It is up to us as individuals to invest our time, energy and resources on the technologies and projects that we believe in, provide meaningful value to our organizations and joy to our lives.
