Commenters tend to be a bunch of crazies wandering the internet like it’s the zombie apocalypse. It’s a striking contrast to the rational human beings whom I have sensible arguments.

I’m taking the high tech approach and asking people to email me instead:

No more anonimity. No more public audience by default. Just you talking to me — and isn’t that how it should always be?

<h3>So, Ask.</h3>

Be polite, be reasonable and I’ll respond back.

And if I think it’s something my audience might be interested in, I’ll post it to the site for all to see.
